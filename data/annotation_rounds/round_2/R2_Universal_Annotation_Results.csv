Crucially, the Duchess does not choose to make a world of philosophy or of abstracted forms, symbols, or ideas like the models she rejects, but instead a world of anthropomorphized matter, a foundational quality that renders humans and nature of the same cloth. As with all science fiction, the fantastical worlds constructed in one’s imagination only become coherent when expressed in fragments of common knowledge: Huxley’s flying cars in Brave New World are cars nevertheless, just like the purplish complexions of the beast-men in the Blazing World are only comprehensible to the Empress in terms of the skin colors of her native world. That the semiotics of science fiction works this way is not new; but that Cavendish chooses anthropomorphism in The Blazing World (and in Observations) as a distinct method for acknowledging and describing the ways in which nature is already animated is highly relevant to our contemporary studies of both the Anthropocene and Cavendish. Though one of the most formidable challenges for natural philosophers in Cavendish’s early modern England was to systematize experimentation such that experimental science could more reliably earn Sprat’s rhetorical claim to “Real Knowledge,” perhaps one of the most formidable challenges of the Anthropocene age is to rethink the kind of “Real Knowledge” that positions nature as an inanimate object in relation to the human subject, and thus to learn how to articulate our world as animated with us, not in opposition to us.",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.8333333333333333

Endpoints DFT provides a framework for computing solvation free energies by combining molecular simulations with a version of the classical density-functional theory of solutions which focuses on., the indirect (solvent-mediated) part of the solute-solvent potential of mean force (indirect PMF). The simulations are performed at the endpoints of a hypothetical charging process which transforms the solvent density from the pure liquid state to that of the solution state. The endpoints DFT expression for solvation free energy can be shown to be equivalent to the standard expression for which the key quantity is the direct correlation function, but it has the advantage that the indirect term. is more focused on the change in solvent-solvent correlations with respect to the pure liquid as the solute is inserted into the solution. In this Perspective, we review recent developments of endpoints DFT, highlighting a series of papers we have written together beginning in 2017. We emphasize the importance of dimensionality reduction as the key to the evaluation of endpoints DFT expressions and present a recently developed, spatially resolved version of the theory.

Endpoints DFT can also be employed in materials science; an example involving the rational design strategy for polymer membrane separation is described. The endpoints DFT method is a scheme to evaluate the solvation free energy by introducing approximations to integrate the classical density functional over a charging parameter.

Smokers provided feedback on the images and reported on the perceived urge to smoke, qualities of reality/coexistence, and general feedback about quality and functioning. The feedback was used to refine the augmented reality images within the app. Methods: In collaboration with an augmented reality design company, we developed 6 smoking-related images (cigarette, lighter, ashtray, lit cigarette in ashtray, etc) and 6 neutral images similar in size or complexity for comparison (pen, eraser, notebook, soda bottle with droplets, etc). Ten smokers completed a survey of demographic characteristics, smoking history and behavior, dependence on nicotine, motivation to quit smoking, and familiarity with augmented reality technology. Then, participants viewed each augmented reality image and provided ratings on 10-point Likert scales for urge to smoke and reality/coexistence of the image into the scene. Participants were also queried with open-ended questions regarding the features of the images. Results: Of the 10 participants, 5 (50%) had experienced augmented reality prior to the laboratory visit, but only 4 of those 5 participants used augmented reality at least weekly. Although the sample was small (N=10), smokers reported significantly higher urge to smoke after viewing the smoking-related augmented reality images (median 4.58, SD 3.49) versus the neutral images (median 1.42, SD 3.01) (Z=-2.14, P=.03; d=0.70). The average reality and coexistence ratings of the images did not differ between smoking-related and neutral images (all P>.29). Augmented reality images were found on average to be realistic (mean [SD] score 6.49 [3.11]) and have good environmental coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.93 [3.04]) and user coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.38 [3.27]) on the 10-point scale. Participant interviews revealed some areas of excellence (eg, details of the lit cigarette) and areas for improvement (eg, stability of images, lighting). Conclusions: All images were generally perceived as being realistic and well-integrated into the environment. However, the smoking augmented reality images produced higher urge to smoke than the neutral augmented reality images. In total, our findings support the potential utility of augmented reality for cue exposure therapy.

When the monitoring network is managed by many operators, as in the case of the Emilia-Romagna regional plan, it becomes necessary to develop a quality control methodology capable of highlighting the possible data incoherency and ensuring that the monitoring system provides reliable data. This paper presents the procedure applied in the egg counting phase as developed in Emilia-Romagna in order to check the data quality and validate the data before being included in the database. Several steps have been identified and protocols developed to serve quality control such as training of technicians and intralaboratory quality check, daily random double counting of Masonite paddles and interlaboratory periodic comparison. The qualitative test showed that all operators were able to distinguish Aedes albopictus eggs from other mosquito species eggs. The quantitative test showed significant differences between the 11 operators, with a relative error resulting in the range of 0.1-25.8%. The daily internal double counting of randomly extracted Masonite slides was performed by the coordinator showing a relative error in the range 2.47-2.63% without statistical differences, confirming a good alignment of the operators with the coordinator throughout the monitoring period. The interlaboratory comparison trial produced an average relative error of 7.20% showing a sufficient alignment between the three laboratories.

In this study, we investigated the expression and functional interaction between miR-141-3p and TSC1 in esophageal cancer cells. Experiments were conducted in four esophageal cancer lines and in tumor cells isolated from human esophageal cancer specimens by laser capture microdissection. miR-141-3p expression was measured by real time and droplet digital PCR. Biotinylated RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays were used to assess binding. miR-141-3p function was tested by assessing proliferation, migration, invasion, and induction of autophagy following its silencing. We found that miR-141-3p levels were increased in TE7, OE33, and TE10 esophageal cancer cells compared to FLO-1 cells, with similar heterogeneity observed in human esophageal cancer specimens. Silencing of miR-141-3p led to increased TSC1 protein expression in these cells and was associated with increased TSC1 translation. Binding studies reveal that miR-141-3p binds to each of the predicted binding sites in the 3 '-untranslated region of TSC1 mRNA. Following miR-141-3p silencing, TE7, OE33, and TE10 cells exhibited decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as enhanced autophagy. Importantly, these phenotypic effects were replicated by overexpression of TSC1 alone in these cells. Our results indicate that miR-141-3p functions in an oncogenic capacity in a subset of esophageal cancer cells, in part by suppressing TSC1 expression.",,,,,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.3333333333333333

Design: Cross-sectional survey based on components of the Health Belief Model Setting: Administered in-person at a Franco-American cultural center and online through mailing lists and social media platforms in the Northeastern United States Sample: Franco-Americans and French Canadians (n = 170) Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics (i.e. high cholesterol, prior heart attack or stroke, family history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diagnosis of FH), perceived barriers to accessing health care services, self-efficacy, and health-promoting behaviors (i.e. taking lipid-lowering medications, seeing a cardiovascular specialist). Results: In a cohort of Franco-Americans, 42 (25%) had both high cholesterol and family history of ASCVD. Among Franco-Americans with both cardiovascular risk factors, 22% had low self-efficacy and only 16% had discussed FH with their physician. Individuals with both risk factors were significantly more likely to report a concern over a future diagnosis as a barrier to accessing health care services when compared with those with neither risk factor (36% vs. 15%, p = 0.014). Overall, other prominent barriers to care included knowledge of when to seek help (27%) and a distrust in medicine (26%).

Entry of FA into the human body can have adverse effects on human health, depending on the FA concentration. Thus, a quantitative analysis of FA in blood is necessary in order to estimate its effect on the human body. In this study, a simple and rapid analytical method for the quantitation of FA in blood was developed. The total analysis time, including the pretreatment procedure, was less than 20 min. To ensure a stable analysis, blood samples were stabilized using tripotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution, and FA was selectively derivatized using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as pretreatment procedures. The pretreated samples were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-UV system, which is the most common choice for analyzing small-molecule aldehydes like formaldehyde. Verification of the pretreatment methods (stabilization and derivatization) using FA standards confirmed that the pretreatment methods are highly reliable in the calibration range 0.012-5.761 ng mu L-1 (slope = 684,898, R-2 = 0.9998, and limit of detection = 0.251 pg center dot mu L-1). Analysis of FA in the blood samples of a Yucatan minipig using the new method revealed an average FA concentration of 1.98 0.34 ng mu L-1 (n = 3). Blood samples spiked with FA standards were analyzed, and the FA concentrations were found to be similar to the theoretical concentrations (2.16 0.81% difference).

Methods: The patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 10(9)/L) following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA from January 2010 to December 2018 in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected. And the high-risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of severe thrombocytopenia were analyzed. Results: A total of 1,581 children with transcatheter occlusion of a PDA were collected; 22 (1.39%) of the enrolled patients had severe thrombocytopenia. Further data analysis showed that the median diameter of PDA (6.7 [IQR: 1.63]) mm in children with severe thrombocytopenia was significantly larger than that in children without severe thrombocytopenia (3.6 +/- 1.7 mm, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the incidence of thrombocytopenia in children with residual shunt after operation (10.9%) was significantly higher than that in children without residual shunt (0.2%, p < 0.001). The mean time of thrombocytopenia was found to be 2.4 +/- 1.3 days after intervention. All patients with thrombocytopenia were treated by methylprednisolone with or without platelet transfusion and recovered without major organ hemorrhage. Conclusions: Severe thrombocytopenia following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA may be related to the larger diameter of PDA and residual shunt.

This survey's foremost objective is to find the optimum attack angle for the highest heat transfer performance in the studied geometry. The attained results demonstrated that the Rayleigh number's augmentation leads to buoyancy force amplification and intensification of velocity components in the enclosure. Hence, the shapes of streamlines for each attack angle are different from the other states. The enhancement of the Rayleigh number causes better temperature distribution between cold and hot sources. The attack angle changes are the other factor for creating and intensity of the temperature gradients. By increasing the attack angle when the heat is transferred from the hot source to the top of the enclosure, the thermal distribution effects come with high gradients due to the flow balance disturbance and the changes in two sources' location. As the fluid moves, velocity components always change. In Rayleigh number of Ra = 1 x 10(3) due to a decrease of buoyancy force and negligible density changes in the enclosure, the average friction coefficient (C-fave) is not considerable, and for everyone studied attack angles, these changes are negligible.

It is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as vectors and birds as reservoir hosts. Despite massive die-offs in wild bird populations and the detection of severe neurological symptoms in infected humans, little is known about which mosquito species are involved in the propagation of USUV. Methods In the present study, the vector competence of a German (i.e. ""Central European"") and a Serbian (i.e. ""Southern European"") Culex pipiens biotype molestus laboratory colony was experimentally evaluated. For comparative purposes, Culex torrentium, a frequent species in Northern Europe, and Aedes aegypti, a primarily tropical species, were also tested. Adult female mosquitoes were exposed to bovine blood spiked with USUV Africa 2 and subsequently incubated at 25 degrees C. After 2 to 3 weeks saliva was collected from each individual mosquito to assess the ability of a mosquito species to transmit USUV. Results Culex pipiens biotype molestus mosquitoes originating from Germany and the Republic of Serbia and Cx. torrentium mosquitoes from Germany proved competent for USUV, as indicated by harboring viable virus in their saliva 21 days post infection. By contrast, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were relatively refractory to an USUV infection, exhibiting low infection rates and lacking virus in their saliva. Conclusions Consistent with the high prevalences and abundances of Cx. pipiens biotype molestus and Cx. torrentium in Central and Northern Europe, these two species have most likely played a historic role in the spread, maintenance, and introduction of USUV into Germany.

Moreover, both the borrowed and imposed legal codes that make up contemporary Japanese law are implemented quite differently in Japan than they are in Europe and North America. Japan as well as other Asian countries has always been less litigious than the United States, and the number of lawyers and lawsuits per capita actually declined during the three decades following the end of the Pacific War. The Japanese make much heavier use of arbitration and informal dispute resolution processes than do Westerners.33

A final area of the failure of imposed institutions was the effort to bring Japan’s bureaucratic apparatus under greater democratic control, or in other words, to reduce its autonomy.

Russian liberal nationalists and pan-Slavs were likely to favour a forward policy on the Turkish Straits and a posture of solidarity with the Slavic ‘little brothers’ on the Balkan peninsula. Conservatives, by contrast, tended to be acutely aware of Russia’s inner political and financial weakness and the dangers – as Kokovtsov put it – of pursuing ‘an active foreign policy at the expense of the peasant’s stomach’; they therefore favoured a policy of peace at all costs.49

When the significance of the Bosnian annexation crisis was debated in the Duma in the spring of 1909, for example, the conservative interests represented in the Council of the United Nobility argued that the annexation had in no way damaged Russian interests or security and that Russia should adopt a policy of complete non-interference in Balkan affairs, while seeking reconciliation with Berlin. The real enemy, they argued, was Britain, which was trying to push Russia into a war with Germany in order to consolidate British control of world markets. Against this position, the pro-French and pro-British liberals of the Constitutional Democrat (Cadet) Party called for the transformation of the Triple Entente into a Triple Alliance that would enable Russia to project power in the Balkan region and arrest the decline of its great power status.50 This was one of the central problems confronting all the foreign policy executives (and those who try to understand them today): the ‘national interest’ was not an objective imperative pressing in upon government from the world outside, but the projection of particular interests within the political elite itself.51

The danger was not great that circumstance would force him to swim in the channel, but the danger existed and was peculiar to the locality to which his job brought him; and it was out of this special danger that the employee's injury arose. This, taken together with the other elements of job connection which the administrator thought relevant, rendered an award in the case consistent with the broad purposes of the compensation statute. Yet had the Deputy Commissioner come out the other way, I think that his decision would have been equally supportable. Although it was true that the injury was related to an especially dangerous channel with which the employee's job brought him into proximity, the administrator could have ruled that the danger, although special, was so remote that the connection between the job and the injury was not sufficient to justify compensation.",,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.3333333333333335

It is objected that the court in its instructions spoke of Davis as an original promisor, as one promising to pay the debt, and not as one promising to be responsible for the debt, or to see it paid. But as Davis, in the second conversation promised to pay, and in the third admitted that he had always promised to pay the debt, we cannot think that the court misinterpreted the scope and effect of his words. It is not probable that the parties to this transaction understood the difference between an original and a collateral promise. We must interpret Davis's promises in the light of the surroundings, and of his subsequent admissions, and in that light we cannot think that the court erred in its construction thereof; and if the jury believed that he had made such promises, we cannot doubt that the verdict should have been as it was.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.8333333333333335

Fortunately, the ride had been made at a canter and he’d been able to clench his mount between his legs and smother the worst farts against his saddle—although the horse had tossed her head at some of the more drawn-out ones—but as they came in sight of the mission station, the major spurred them into a trot and then a gallop so that their pennant snapped overhead like a whip. Legs braced in the stirrups, knees bent, his body canted forward over his mount’s neck, the lieutenant had had no choice but to release a crackling stream of utterance. At first there was some undeniable relief in this, but as each dip and rise and tussock jarred loose further bursts, he was obliged to cry “Ya” and “Ho,” as if encouraging his horse, to mask the worst outbreaks.
