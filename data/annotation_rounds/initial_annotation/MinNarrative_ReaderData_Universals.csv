Crucially, the Duchess does not choose to make a world of philosophy or of abstracted forms, symbols, or ideas like the models she rejects, but instead a world of anthropomorphized matter, a foundational quality that renders humans and nature of the same cloth. As with all science fiction, the fantastical worlds constructed in one’s imagination only become coherent when expressed in fragments of common knowledge: Huxley’s flying cars in Brave New World are cars nevertheless, just like the purplish complexions of the beast-men in the Blazing World are only comprehensible to the Empress in terms of the skin colors of her native world. That the semiotics of science fiction works this way is not new; but that Cavendish chooses anthropomorphism in The Blazing World (and in Observations) as a distinct method for acknowledging and describing the ways in which nature is already animated is highly relevant to our contemporary studies of both the Anthropocene and Cavendish. Though one of the most formidable challenges for natural philosophers in Cavendish’s early modern England was to systematize experimentation such that experimental science could more reliably earn Sprat’s rhetorical claim to “Real Knowledge,” perhaps one of the most formidable challenges of the Anthropocene age is to rethink the kind of “Real Knowledge” that positions nature as an inanimate object in relation to the human subject, and thus to learn how to articulate our world as animated with us, not in opposition to us.",3025,1.3333333333333333,1,1,2,1,3,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,2.0,0.012,0.222222222,NEG,7.88888888888889,0.0173010380622837,14,3,0.202057594358104,1.86854671280277,NEG,31,0.069204152249135,0,0.0657439446366782,0,46,34,0,0,1,0,1,43,19,0,21,0,5,7,15,1,2,0,1,0.0103806228373702,0.041522491349481,0,0.52,0.0,12,0,8,2,3,2,3,11,4,0,2,8,4
NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_751.txt,"Background: Our aim is to analyze the correlation between severe thrombocytopenia and the diameter of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and residual shunt after PDA closure. Methods: The patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 10(9)/L) following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA from January 2010 to December 2018 in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected. And the high-risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of severe thrombocytopenia were analyzed. Results: A total of 1,581 children with transcatheter occlusion of a PDA were collected; 22 (1.39%) of the enrolled patients had severe thrombocytopenia. Further data analysis showed that the median diameter of PDA (6.7 [IQR: 1.63]) mm in children with severe thrombocytopenia was significantly larger than that in children without severe thrombocytopenia (3.6 +/- 1.7 mm, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the incidence of thrombocytopenia in children with residual shunt after operation (10.9%) was significantly higher than that in children without residual shunt (0.2%, p < 0.001). The mean time of thrombocytopenia was found to be 2.4 +/- 1.3 days after intervention. All patients with thrombocytopenia were treated by methylprednisolone with or without platelet transfusion and recovered without major organ hemorrhage. Conclusions: Severe thrombocytopenia following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA may be related to the larger diameter of PDA and residual shunt. If early detection of severe thrombocytopenia is obtained, our study supports a good prognosis if appropriate measures are implemented. (c) 2020 S.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_341.txt,"The effects of cold plasma on the enzymatic activity, color, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of avocado pulp with lime extract (PL) and without extract (PW) were studied. The experimental conditions applied varied with regard to time (10, 20, and 30 min) and gas flow (10, 20, and 30 ml). The gas flow combination of 20 ml/20 min applied in PL was efficient for reducing POD and PPO activities and browning index as well as for color maintenance. Cold plasma increased the phenolic and carotenoid levels in PW in T1 and T2 (gas flow 10 ml/10-30 min) and in PL in T3 and T8 (gas flow 30 ml/10 min and 20 ml/30 min), which contributed to the improvement in antioxidant activity. The phenolic showed a strong correlation with ORAC-H in PL (0.85) and PW (0.75). Myristic and palmitic acid were reduced after applying cold plasma, however, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic increased the content. It is concluded that the synergistic effect of lime extract in avocado pulp with cold plasma technology is efficient at maintaining the quality characteristics and improving the bioactive content. Practical applications Cold plasma processing is an alternative method of effective maintenance for enzyme control, and it also shows promising results in the conservation of chemical quality and in increasing the levels of bioactive compounds and increasing the antioxidant capacity in fruit products, such as avocado pulp. Avocado has gained prominence in the market due to knowledge of its nutritional characteristics; however, its commercialization is hampered mainly by a high concentration of enzymes that cause enzymatic browning, such as polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, which favor the appearance of degradation reactions, compromising the quality of the fruit.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_724.txt,"Human beings are easily exposed to formaldehyde (FA) in a living environment. Entry of FA into the human body can have adverse effects on human health, depending on the FA concentration. Thus, a quantitative analysis of FA in blood is necessary in order to estimate its effect on the human body. In this study, a simple and rapid analytical method for the quantitation of FA in blood was developed. The total analysis time, including the pretreatment procedure, was less than 20 min. To ensure a stable analysis, blood samples were stabilized using tripotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution, and FA was selectively derivatized using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as pretreatment procedures. The pretreated samples were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-UV system, which is the most common choice for analyzing small-molecule aldehydes like formaldehyde. Verification of the pretreatment methods (stabilization and derivatization) using FA standards confirmed that the pretreatment methods are highly reliable in the calibration range 0.012-5.761 ng mu L-1 (slope = 684,898, R-2 = 0.9998, and limit of detection = 0.251 pg center dot mu L-1). Analysis of FA in the blood samples of a Yucatan minipig using the new method revealed an average FA concentration of 1.98 0.34 ng mu L-1 (n = 3). Blood samples spiked with FA standards were analyzed, and the FA concentrations were found to be similar to the theoretical concentrations (2.16 0.81% difference). The method reported herein can quantitatively analyze FA in blood at a sub-nanogram level within a short period of time and is validated for application in blood analysis.",5047,1.0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1.444444444,0.004,0.1481481483,NEG,5.375,0.0039840637450199,6,11,0.221898587391946,1.73812749003984,NEG,26,0.0836653386454183,0,0.0836653386454183,0,32,30,1,0,5,0,2,79,4,0,14,0,0,1,6,0,1,0,5,0.0079681274900398,0.0398406374501992,0,0.384615384615385,0.0159362549800797,5,0,5,9,8,10,2,3,1,0,0,0,0

Design: Cross-sectional survey based on components of the Health Belief Model Setting: Administered in-person at a Franco-American cultural center and online through mailing lists and social media platforms in the Northeastern United States Sample: Franco-Americans and French Canadians (n = 170) Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics (i.e. high cholesterol, prior heart attack or stroke, family history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diagnosis of FH), perceived barriers to accessing health care services, self-efficacy, and health-promoting behaviors (i.e. taking lipid-lowering medications, seeing a cardiovascular specialist). Results: In a cohort of Franco-Americans, 42 (25%) had both high cholesterol and family history of ASCVD. Among Franco-Americans with both cardiovascular risk factors, 22% had low self-efficacy and only 16% had discussed FH with their physician. Individuals with both risk factors were significantly more likely to report a concern over a future diagnosis as a barrier to accessing health care services when compared with those with neither risk factor (36% vs. 15%, p = 0.014). Overall, other prominent barriers to care included knowledge of when to seek help (27%) and a distrust in medicine (26%). Conclusion: Franco-Americans report significant barriers to accessing health care services.

A full explanation of Khrushchev’s speech and its aftermath and of the social processes surrounding the history and memory of Stalinist collective violence requires the articulation of novel theoretical positions. Analyses of legacies of mass historical violence in Europe and elsewhere typically cast the social arena as a battleground between memory and oblivion, projecting psychic mechanisms associated with the aftermath of trauma—most frequently those of repression and repetition compulsion—as metaphors for collective processes in which a society as a whole is conceived as repressing memory of past events, memory that must be brought to the fore if recovery and amelioration are to take place. Yet memory, forgetting, and repression are precisely the wrong terms for analysis of legacies of Stalinist mass violence in the USSR—and in present-day Russia as well.

Dimeric pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 (PKM2) acts as a key protein kinase in aberrant glycolysis by promoting the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, while tetrameric PKM2 functions as a pyruvate kinase in oxidative phosphorylation. The aim of the research is to study the effect of PKM2 tetramer activation on preventing kidney fibrosis via suppression of aberrant glycolysis and the EMT program. Materials and methods In vivo: Streptozotocin (STZ) was utilized to induce diabetes in 8-week-old CD-1 mice; 4 weeks after diabetes induction, proteinuria-induced kidney fibrosis was developed by intraperitoneal injection of bovine serum albumin (BSA: 0.3 g/30 g BW) for 14 days; The PKM2 activator TEPP-46 was also administered orally simultaneously. In vitro: HK2 cells were co-treated with high-glucose media or/and TGF-beta 1 and TEPP46 for 48 h, cellular protein was extracted for evaluation. Results Diabetic mice developed kidney fibrosis associated with aberrant glycolysis and EMT; BSA injection accelerated kidney fibrosis in both the control and diabetic mice; TEPP-46 rescued the kidney fibrosis. In HK2 cells, TEPP-46 suppressed the EMT program induced by TGF-beta 1 and/or high-glucose incubation. TEPP-46-induced PKM2 tetramer formation and PK activity resulted in suppression of HIF-1 alpha and lactate accumulation. Specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1 alpha expression diminished high glucose-induced mesenchymal protein levels. Conclusion PKM2 activation could restore the tubular phenotype via suppression of the EMT program and aberrant glycolysis, providing an alternative target to mitigate fibrosis in diabetic kidneys.",5054,1.0,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1.333333333,0.016,0.2222222223,NEG,4.15384615384615,0.0038910505836575,12,8,0.0913047138047138,1.45338521400778,NEG,16,0.0778210116731518,0,0.0350194552529183,4,32,30,0,0,6,0,1,102,2,1,13,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0.0038910505836575,0.0038910505836575,0,0.736842105263158,0.0194552529182879,3,0,4,11,3,8,0,4,0,0,0,0,0
NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_13.txt,"Many studies, experimental, theoretical, and numerical, have been done on polymer nanocomposites, but nearly all of them have focused on a particular type of material system or some specific material properties. A comprehensive understanding of this complicated material system is still quite lacking. The objective of this study is to use mesoscale finite element simulation to gain insights on the reinforcing efficiencies of different types of carbon nanofillers as distinguished by their geometries and interfacial strengths. It is demonstrated that CNT (carbon nanotube) and CNF (carbon nanofiber) have larger load carrying capacity and potentially higher reinforcing efficiency than GNP (graphite nanoplatelet) due to their larger aspect ratio and physical length. However, the higher load carrying capacity is also associated with higher interfacial stress which can lead to earlier debonding, particularly for CNT. GNP, on the other hand, has lower load carrying capacity, and is thus less sensitive to the bonding condition and less susceptible to debonding. The overall reinforcing efficiency is a manifestation of the interplay between the load carrying capacity of the filler, which is limited by filler's geometry, and the load transfer capability at the interface, which is limited by the filler/matrix interfacial strength. This interplay is also reflected in the effects of filler orientation on reinforcing efficiency. The insights gained from this study can be used to devise a strategy for developing advanced nanocomposites, such as hybrid composites.",3050,1.3333333333333333,1,2,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1.555555556,0.008,0.5185185187,NEG,5.66666666666667,0.0,10,0,0.195285858908781,1.92344827586207,NEG,24,0.0905172413793103,0,0.0646551724137931,0,28,23,8,0,3,0,2,56,4,0,13,0,1,4,9,1,0,0,3,0.0,0.0517241379310345,0,0.590909090909091,0.0,7,0,5,1,10,10,3,10,3,0,0,0,0

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_921.txt,"In this presentation, flow physics and natural heat transfer of water/Ag nanofluid are implemented by utilizing finite volume method (FVM) considering 0-6% of solid nanoparticles in volume fraction in an elliptical-shaped enclosure affected by different attack angles range from 45 degrees to 135 degrees. This survey's foremost objective is to find the optimum attack angle for the highest heat transfer performance in the studied geometry. The attained results demonstrated that the Rayleigh number's augmentation leads to buoyancy force amplification and intensification of velocity components in the enclosure. Hence, the shapes of streamlines for each attack angle are different from the other states. The enhancement of the Rayleigh number causes better temperature distribution between cold and hot sources. The attack angle changes are the other factor for creating and intensity of the temperature gradients. By increasing the attack angle when the heat is transferred from the hot source to the top of the enclosure, the thermal distribution effects come with high gradients due to the flow balance disturbance and the changes in two sources' location. As the fluid moves, velocity components always change. In Rayleigh number of Ra = 1 x 10(3) due to a decrease of buoyancy force and negligible density changes in the enclosure, the average friction coefficient (C-fave) is not considerable, and for everyone studied attack angles, these changes are negligible. By augmenting attack angle (attack angles of 90 degrees and 135 degrees), because the tangential velocity component is weakened by gravity force, the values of created surface stress and fluid adhesion to the hot surface are less.",5087,1.0,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,2,1,1,3,1,1.666666667,0.012,0.2222222223,NEG,3.5,0.0,10,9,0.088034188034188,1.96374045801527,NEG,33,0.0648854961832061,0,0.0610687022900763,0,36,24,1,1,4,0,0,78,3,0,26,0,3,0,3,1,0,0,4,0.0,0.0419847328244275,0,0.52,0.0,7,0,1,1,5,8,8,6,0,0,1,0,0
