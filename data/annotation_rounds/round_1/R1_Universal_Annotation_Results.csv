The way to make yourself important and necessary is to define a problem in such a way that only your involvement or intercession will solve it. Thus, science and engineering can be made to seem like the source of a problem that only the balm of letting-be can mitigate. One can see something similar in the ways in which the problem of the fantasy-object known as “capitalism” is construed in the humanities. Much political thinking is motivated by the effort to anthropomorphize capitalism—and one can tell this is going on whenever capitalism is referred to as “capital.” This discursive move allows one to imagine capitalism as an ideology or even an intentional and self-willing subject rather than a set of structures and conditions.",,,,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.1111111111111112

These are some of the questions I will grapple with over the next pages. Inevitably, there is a degree of simplification involved in my discussion, since any cognitive-scientific approach to literature is likely to be heterogeneous in its sources and methods: interpretation is an aspect of literary scholarship, perhaps a key aspect, but it still cannot account for everything literary scholars do or write. This is especially true for cognitive approaches to literature, where—as I will suggest—interpretive aims often exist side by side with other projects, such as theorizing readers’ responses or exploring literature’s relationship with its sociocultural contexts.

4,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_13.txt,"Many studies, experimental, theoretical, and numerical, have been done on polymer nanocomposites, but nearly all of them have focused on a particular type of material system or some specific material properties. A comprehensive understanding of this complicated material system is still quite lacking. The objective of this study is to use mesoscale finite element simulation to gain insights on the reinforcing efficiencies of different types of carbon nanofillers as distinguished by their geometries and interfacial strengths. It is demonstrated that CNT (carbon nanotube) and CNF (carbon nanofiber) have larger load carrying capacity and potentially higher reinforcing efficiency than GNP (graphite nanoplatelet) due to their larger aspect ratio and physical length. However, the higher load carrying capacity is also associated with higher interfacial stress which can lead to earlier debonding, particularly for CNT. GNP, on the other hand, has lower load carrying capacity, and is thus less sensitive to the bonding condition and less susceptible to debonding. The overall reinforcing efficiency is a manifestation of the interplay between the load carrying capacity of the filler, which is limited by filler's geometry, and the load transfer capability at the interface, which is limited by the filler/matrix interfacial strength. This interplay is also reflected in the effects of filler orientation on reinforcing efficiency. The insights gained from this study can be used to devise a strategy for developing advanced nanocomposites, such as hybrid composites.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.2222222222222223
5,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_440.txt,"Purpose This research investigated whether structuring an inquiry-oriented professional learning network to include school-based co-teaching partners would amplify educators' success in taking up and adapting evidence-based understandings and practices as meaningful in their contexts. Our research questions were: (1) What conditions did educators identify in the PLN overall that supported their co-construction of knowledge and practice development together? and (2) How did including co-teaching partners in the PLN help participants to mobilize knowledge and/or practices in the contexts where they were working? Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study design was used because of its potential to examine how and why questions about complex processes as situated in context (Butler, 2011; Yin, 2014). A case study methodology allowed us to collect and coordinate multiple forms of evidence (i.e. interviews, teacher reflective writing, classroom artifacts, field notes) to examine both how conditions created within the PLN supported learning and how co-teaching partners were mobilizing what they were learning in their school contexts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data was analyzed abductively through an iterative and recursive process (Braun et al., 2018). Findings Conditions within the PLN overall that participants identified as supportive to their knowledge mobilization and practice development included: having a shared focus, feeling accountability to the group, collaborative enactment of practices within the PLN, large group sharing and debriefing, sustained cycles of collaborative inquiry, affective support, valuing diversity and drawing from expert others as resources. Participants also identified the benefits that accrued specifically from working with co-teaching partners. In addition, findings showed how the degree to which partners engaged in rich forms of collaborative inquiry could be related to their learning and situated practice development. Originality/value Findings show the generative potential of inviting co-teaching partners into a PLN to engage in collaborative inquiry with others. PLNs offer the benefit of engaging with educators from outside of one's practice context, which enables pushing their thinking in new directions. Our findings add to the literature by revealing how in situ knowledge mobilization can be amplified when educators participating within a PLN are also working through cycles of inquiry with a co-teaching partner. Overall, this study offers a PLN model where teachers have built-in support for knowledge co-creation and mobilization both within and outside of their school contexts.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.2222222222222223
6,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_558.txt,"Aims/Introduction Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy and is associated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and aberrant glycolysis. Dimeric pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 (PKM2) acts as a key protein kinase in aberrant glycolysis by promoting the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, while tetrameric PKM2 functions as a pyruvate kinase in oxidative phosphorylation. The aim of the research is to study the effect of PKM2 tetramer activation on preventing kidney fibrosis via suppression of aberrant glycolysis and the EMT program. Materials and methods In vivo: Streptozotocin (STZ) was utilized to induce diabetes in 8-week-old CD-1 mice; 4 weeks after diabetes induction, proteinuria-induced kidney fibrosis was developed by intraperitoneal injection of bovine serum albumin (BSA: 0.3 g/30 g BW) for 14 days; The PKM2 activator TEPP-46 was also administered orally simultaneously. In vitro: HK2 cells were co-treated with high-glucose media or/and TGF-beta 1 and TEPP46 for 48 h, cellular protein was extracted for evaluation. Results Diabetic mice developed kidney fibrosis associated with aberrant glycolysis and EMT; BSA injection accelerated kidney fibrosis in both the control and diabetic mice; TEPP-46 rescued the kidney fibrosis. In HK2 cells, TEPP-46 suppressed the EMT program induced by TGF-beta 1 and/or high-glucose incubation. TEPP-46-induced PKM2 tetramer formation and PK activity resulted in suppression of HIF-1 alpha and lactate accumulation. Specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1 alpha expression diminished high glucose-induced mesenchymal protein levels. Conclusion PKM2 activation could restore the tubular phenotype via suppression of the EMT program and aberrant glycolysis, providing an alternative target to mitigate fibrosis in diabetic kidneys.",,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.1111111111111112
