HUMMINGBIRDS. 215


[Nest of the Humming bi: d | -
may with great propriety place here the smallest
and prettiest nests with which we are acquainted, those
of the hummingbirds, with whose appearance many of
our readers may be familiar, as they are by no means uncommon
in museums â€” their extreme neatness of execution,
and their minute size, causing them to be highly
prized. By far the best description of these which we
ave met with, is that by Wi son of the red throated
hummingbird. â€œAbout the 25th of April, â€ he says,
â€œthe hummingbird usually arrives in Pennsylvania, and
about the 10th of May begins to build its nest.",5,19CNONFIC,19CNONFIC_5S_chi-086857689-norm.txt,3,4,4,3.666666667,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2.333333333,,2.333333333,2.666666667,3,2.666666667,1,2,2,1.666666667,1.666666667,0.666666667

The lower hackle feathers and those of the saddle should
both end with a black spangle, not necessarily sharply
defined, but somewhat rayed in appearance; the plumage
of the back, also, should have spangles of black on the
end of each feather. These spangles are more apparent
when feathers are examined separately, and the more
firmly feathers are in their places, the better. Feathers
loosely set on do not show the starry or rayed spangles
to advantage. The feathers of the breast and body should
each end with a large moon or spangle, round, greenish
black in colour, sharply defined and separate to appearance. When the feathers on the breast do not hold their
proper places, or when the spangles are oblong, they join
each other in patches of black, thus injuring the appearance
of the cock very materially.",24,19CNONFIC,19CNONFIC_5S_coo-31924003689696-norm.txt,1,4,5,3.333333333,1,1,4,2,1,2,4,2.333333333,,1,2.333333333,4.333333333,2.555555556,0,3,1,1.333333333,1.333333333,0.518518519

THE CAREW MURDER CASE

NEARLY a year later, in the month of October, 18â€”-, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone up-stairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing.",673,NOVEL19C,NOVEL19C_5S_1-EN_1886_Stevenson-RobertLouis_JekyllandHyde_Novel.txt,5,4,5,4.666666667,3,5,5,4.333333333,4,4,4,4,,4,4.333333333,4.666666667,4.333333333,2,1,1,0.666666667,1.333333333,0.222222222

"And as the faint light of his course pierced into the dwellings of men, it fell, as now, on the rosy warmth of nestling children; on the haggard waking of sorrow and sickness; on the hasty uprising of the hard-handed labourer; and on the late sleep of the night-student, who had been questioning the stars or the sages, or his own soul, for that hidden knowledge which would break through the barrier of manâ€™s brief life, and show its dark path, that seemed to bend no whither, to be an arc in an immeasurable circle of light and glory.

Even if, instead of following the dim daybreak, our imagination pauses on a certain historical spot and awaits the fuller morning, we may see a world-famous city, which has hardly changed its outline since the days of Columbus, seeming to stand as an almost unviolated symbol, amidst the flux of human things, to remind us that we still resemble the men of the past more than we differ from them, as the great mechanical principles on which those domes and towers were raised must make a likeness in human building that will be broader and deeper than all possible change. And doubtless, if the spirit of a Florentine citizen, whose eyes were closed for the last time while Columbus was still waiting and arguing for the three poor vessels with which he was to set sail from the port of Palos, could return from the shades and pause where our thought is pausing, he would believe that there must still be fellowship and understanding for him among the inheritors of his birthplace.",662,NOVEL19C,NOVEL19C_5S_1-EN_1862_Eliot-George_Romola_Novel.txt,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1.333333333,2,2,3,2.333333333,,2,1.666666667,2,1.888888889,0,1,2,1,1,0.37037037

"For a considerable time Tangier had appeared in sight. Shortly after standing away from Tarifa, we had descried it in the far distance, when it showed like a white dove brooding on its nest. The sun was setting behind the town when we dropped anchor in its harbour, amidst half a dozen barks and felouks about the size of our own, the only vessels which we saw. There stood Tangier before us, and a picturesque town it was, occupying the sides and top of two hills, one of which, bold and bluff, projects into the sea where the coast takes a sudden and abrupt turn. Frowning and battlemented were its walls, either perched on the top of precipitous rocks, whose base was washed by the salt billows, or rising from the narrow strand which separates the hill from the ocean.",639,NOVEL19C,NOVEL19C_5S_1-EN_1843_Borrow-George_TheBibleinSpain_Novel.txt,1,3,5,3,2,3,5,3.333333333,1,2,4,2.333333333,,1.333333333,2.666666667,4.666666667,2.888888889,1,1,1,1,1,0.37037037

When I have seen in my walks the irrational creatures of God, the birds and the beasts, governed by a kindly instinct in attendance on their young, often has it come into my head that love and charity, far more than reason or justice, formed the tie that holds the world, with all its jarring wants and woes, in social dependence and obligation together; and, in this year, a strong verification of the soundness of this notion was exemplified in the conduct of the poor haverel lassie Meg Gaffaw, whose naturality on the occasion of her mother's death I have related at length in this chronicle. In the course of the summer, Mr Henry Melcomb, who was a nephew to Mr Cayenne, came down from England to see his uncle.

"Mr Morton, himself, to whom precedence is due, seemed to be about fifty years of age, was of the middle stature, his features regular, and his countenance placid: he spoke but little, but that little was always mild and often judicious. He appeared not to be void of benevolent affections, and had the character of a humane landlord, but his virtues were, in a great measure, sunk in an habitual indolence of temper; he would sometimes sacrifice his principles to his repose, though never to his interest. His ladyâ€”no, I will not describe her; her character will, it may be, unfold itself to you in futureâ€”Suffice it to say, that her person was gross, her voice loud and discordant, and her features rugged: she affected an air of openness and pleasantry; It may be prejudiced, perhaps she did not affect it. Sarah Morton, the eldest of the daughters, was about my age, she was under the middle height, fair, plump, loquacious; there was a childish levity in her accent and manners, which impressed strangers with an unfavourable opinion of her understanding, but it was an acquired manner, for she was shrewd and sensible.

most important points in connexion with growing
and feeding root crops. To obtain the most profitable
results, it must not only be the variety best
suited to the soil and the one that can be grown
at the lowest cost per bushel, but must also produce
the greatest return when fed to the cows or
fattening stock. We will first speak of the choice of varieties for
feeding in the dairy. It is a generally conceded
fact, which we will speak of in the chapter on feeding,
that coarse, rank varieties of turnips will impart
a strong, unpleasant flavour to the milk or
butter when fed to cows in profit. We think that
this great objection could be largely overcome by

She calculated her letter would reach Cornelia about the end of September, and she thought how pleasantly the hope it brought, would brighten her life. And without permitting Hyde to suspect any change in his love affair, she very often led the conversation to Cornelia, and to the circumstances of her life.
